# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

In this project I have used Dog CEO's Dog API - https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
Plugins used are React Paginate for pagination, Pino as logger library and Tailwind CSS
